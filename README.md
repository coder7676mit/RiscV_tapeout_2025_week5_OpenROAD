## RISC-V Tapeout 2025 — Week 5: OpenROAD Installation & Observations

Welcome to the **RISC-V Tapeout 2025 — Week 5** repository focusing on the installation, observations and error‐tracking of the OpenROAD flow.

### 🧭 Project Scope

This repository captures the full journey of installing and testing the OpenROAD flow for the RISC-V tape-out project in Week 5.  
Key goals include:
- Recording step-by-step installation instructions for OpenROAD and relevant toolchains.  
- Capturing initial observations of processes, behaviour, outputs and performance.  
- Logging all errors encountered during installation and usage, along with resolutions or workarounds.  
- Providing a structured basis for future peers or contributors to reference and build upon.
